kt-update for Debian
-------------------

The intention of kt-update is to automate the process to select apt sources.list
and dist-upgrade the Debian GNU/Linux operating system. Be aware that incoherent
sources.list may break the installation or even your operating system.



Compared to kt-update script in APT:
-------------------------------

APT package has its own script /etc/cron.daily/apt, which can do:
 * fancy auto-clean with rule
 * check and download upgradable packages automatically
 * automatic unattended upgrade
    + need to install unattended-upgrades package
    + aimed for security upgrade and have its blacklist capability
    + mail capability (The extent of this, i do not know for sure?)

These can be enabled via apt configuration variables (usually stored in
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02backup and 50unattended-upgrades).

If the above is what you need, then consider to use that instead of kt-update.



General Configuration:
----------------------

All kt-update configuration is placed in /etc/kt-update/conf.d/.


Configuration file syntax:
--------------------------

The configuration files (/etc/kt-update/conf.d/*.conf) consists of a number
of variables that can be set to values as outlined below. In addition they
follow the POSIX /bin/sh syntax which means that they can be used for hooks
and simlar things as well as simply setting variables. These variables are
described below and/or in a file example.conf attached to the software.


MINTMPDIRSIZE=100

   The minimum amount of disc space (in kB) that need to exist on the
   device where temporary files are created (mktemp) to allow kt-update
   to run. If set to 0 it will always continue even if empty.

LOG="/var/log/kt-update/log"

  The temporary logfile (for debugging). Use syslog for normal logging.


UMASK_APT="022"

  Umask for the files created by the APT command used. In all other cases
  system defined umask will be used.

Regular execution:
------------------

 If you want this tool to be run even if you do not have it up at
 04 in the morning you can create a symbolic link from /etc/cron.daily/kt-update
 to /usr/sbin/kt-update. It will then be run every day (even if the computer is
 not on at that time). Similar things can be done for each week, and so on.
 You have to have anacron installed for this to work. If not, daily scripts
 run 6 AM by crond.

  ln -s /usr/sbin/kt-update /etc/cron.daily/kt-update

 Observe that it is not always a good thing to update package information
 and install packages when the computer is started.

 You also need to disable the normal cron.d/kt-update file if you do not want
 it to be run twice.

 Also note that anacron does not run anything while on battery power.
 So in the event you want to run regular updates also when running on battery
 only you need to change the anacron default setting.
 For more information how to do that see /usr/share/doc/anacron/README.Debian.



Alternate sources.list file
---------------------------

If you just want to update security related things you can always use an
alternate sources.list files by giving this extra information to the OPTIONS
variable in the configuration file.

 OPTIONS="-o quiet=1 --no-list-cleanup -o Dir::Etc::SourceList=/etc/apt/security.sources.list -o Dir::Etc::SourceParts=\"/dev/null\""

Alternatively you can use a separate APT configuration file as described
in the chapter below. You can for example point to a source list as follows:

 Dir::Etc::SourceList "/etc/apt/security.sources.list";
 Dir::Etc::SourceParts "/dev/null"

In that case you only need to update the OPTIONS variable to include the
'--no-list-cleanup' argument.



Alternate APT main configuration
--------------------------------

There are cases when you need the APT configuration for use with kt-update to
differ substantially from your standard configuration. For example, kt-update
will not work with the default configuration of APT, when apt-listbugs is
installed, because this adds a hook that expects keyboard interactivity.

Unfortunately, the apt-tools do not accept Dir::Etc::Main and Dir::Etc::Parts
settings on the command-line. In order to use different paths for them, you
have to create another APT configuration file containing eg:

 Dir::Etc::Main "cron.apt.conf";
 Dir::Etc::Parts "cron.apt.conf.d";

Then uncomment the following line in your kt-update configuration file and
point it to your newly created APT configuration file:

 export APT_CONFIG=/etc/apt/cron.apt.paths

Don't forget additional options you might have set in /etc/apt/apt.conf since
this file is no longer use when APT_CONFIG point to another conf file.
