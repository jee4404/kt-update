Hello,

I have just tried cron-apt and found out there is a feature, I guess is
good, not implemented. I think it is good if there is a choice of sending
mail only if there are some packages to upgrade. I have made patches
against 0.0.7, which implement these features. I am sending you these 
patches (against /etc/cron-apt/action.d/3-download and
/usr/sbin/cron-apt). Can you please apply these patches on next version of
cron-apt?


Thanks
